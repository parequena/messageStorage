# MessageManager



Enclosed is the C++ source code for a simple messaging service application with a command-line interface. It can perform 4 operations:

1.    Add a new user
2.    Send a user a message
3.    Receive all messages for a user
4.    Quit

Your task is to refactor this code so that it utilises modern C++ features and would allow other developers to easily extend the application with alternative user interface implementations e.g. GUI, Touch Screen, Voice Control, Mind Control etc. Please note that we are NOT looking for you to implement any of these additional interfaces.

You may either completely re-write the system from scratch or make appropriate changes to the existing code. You may add new files or delete files as you wish. 

Your solution will be graded against the following criteria:
* Does the code obey the SOLID principles?
* Can the code be easily extended to allow other user interfaces to use the messaging system?
* Have appropriate data structures been used?
* Is the code clean and easy to understand? E.g.
  * Do the class, method and variable names make sense?
  * Do they accurately describe what they're being used for?
  * Can the flow be easily followed?
  * Has a consistent style been used?
* Has appropriate use been made of Modern C++?
* Is the code “const correct”?
* Is the code unit testable? (Note: We do not require unit tests to be written as part of this exercise)
* How scalable is the solution?

We expect the test to take around 2-4 hours to complete.
